									<p class="lead">Her first anxiety attack came when she saw something a little girl shouldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
									<p>Mary Gail Rivera watched her father stab her mother. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was going to do. I thought I was going to die.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>She was 4 or 5 years old then, and now, at 63, she still has anxiety attacks if &ldquo;someone starts anything.&rdquo; She avoids all confrontation. She hates to fight.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with me &mdash; I hold everything in and I get an anxiety attack.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Mary, who grew up in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and sold mistletoe to make money as a child, has been a cook, a dishwasher, a landscaper, a waitress. She is also an artist, creating vibrant paintings that hang in the Irving Street home where she moved several months ago.</p>
									<p>Mary was homeless three times before finding a place at Irving Street, staying in shelters or living with friends. Without medication for her anxiety, she felt jumpy and afraid most of the time. And the things she saw living on the streets only intensified her feelings.</p>
									<p>While staying at the Samaritan House shelter in Denver, she witnessed a couple kicking and hitting each other &mdash; a fight that resulted in a stabbing. Mary saw it from a rooftop, and it brought on a panic attack.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like staying with anybody,&rdquo; she said.</p>
									<p>At Irving Street, she doesn&rsquo;t feel so &ldquo;uptight&rdquo; and &ldquo;agitated.&rdquo; When she feels anxious, she takes a nap or a walk to clear her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think right. I guess that&rsquo;s why I make bad choices.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Mary spends her days painting sunsets and seascapes that remind her of the California coast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about anything else when I paint.&rdquo;</p>

									<p class="lead">Ashley Stanley explains her mental illness this way: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s life wearing on me, and people react to things differently. We are all flawed.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>The 24-year-old is a free spirit, with long, flowing hair and hippie clothes. She is studying to become a massage therapist and three years ago hitched a ride to Colorado from a stranger at an Arby&rsquo;s in Wyoming.</p>
									<p>Ashley, who grew up in Wyoming, says she had a rough childhood, was abused and spent her teenage years in pain from endometriosis. Therapists had told her she had bipolar disorder. Then they changed the diagnosis to &ldquo;behavioral problems&rdquo; and, most recently, post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
									<p>She lived in her Chevy Impala for a summer and has camped out, lived in motels and couch-surfed before moving to Irving Street.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a lot of weird places,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This place has been the best place I&rsquo;ve been so far.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>After living at Irving Street for a month, Ashley was grateful that if she left to go camping, her &ldquo;stuff will still be here.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>She is among the youngest at Irving Street, a house full of pseudo mothers and grandmothers who have adopted her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shown me that there are people that can make it through a lot of stuff and be OK,&rdquo; she said.</p>

									<p class="lead">The voices in her head are never kind.</p>
									<p>Through the television, Kathy Lamer has heard them say: &ldquo;You are not good enough. You are not smart enough. You should go kill yourself.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>That was the worst of it. &ldquo;At the time, the logic piece of my brain wasn&rsquo;t working,&rdquo; said Kathy, 40.</p>
									<p>With therapy, Kathy has learned to recognize the signs that she is about to have a psychotic break. Things become confused. Sudoku, which normally calms her, can suddenly make no sense to her.</p>
									<p>Kathy was first diagnosed with mental illness in 2011, after she had been evicted, was homeless and on probation for a methamphetamine conviction. A psychiatrist with the probation department told her she has bipolar disorder with psychotic features.</p>
									<p>She took meth to self-medicate her swings of mania followed by dark days of depression, including thoughts of killing herself. Mental illness runs in Kathy&rsquo;s family &mdash; her mom has schizophrenia and her dad killed himself.</p>
									<p>After living in the Samaritan House shelter, and even camping out in a field, Kathy received a bed at Irving Street. She lived at the women&rsquo;s home for a year and a half before getting her own apartment last summer.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;It was a huge relief coming to Irving Street. I wasn&rsquo;t in fight or flight anymore. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about where to stay the next day.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Kathy said she was in &ldquo;no shape&rdquo; to live on her own when she arrived at Irving Street; she spent the first few months &ldquo;crawling out of her skin&rdquo; because she couldn&rsquo;t relax. But with therapy, medication and a place to put the pieces back together, she learned how to live on her own again.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Being able to do things on my time has been a huge, wonderful relief to me,&rdquo; Kathy said.</p>
									<p>Some of her best friends still live at Irving Street, so Kathy returns for chicken dinners and birthday parties. Living alone has been a major adjustment.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I really freaked out bad my first night in the apartment,&rdquo; she said. But she sees herself as an example to the women she left behind. &ldquo;It gives them hope for the future. It can be done.&rdquo;</p>

									<p class="lead">It&rsquo;s hard to have a conversation with Marion Warfield.</p>
									<p>She tells you she grew up in &ldquo;different parts of towns and countries,&rdquo; in churches and group homes. She says she had no parents. As an adult, she lived in shelters, but one time she had her own apartment and a job cleaning offices. She can&rsquo;t say when that was.</p>
									<p>She recalls coming to Colorado on a bus by herself, maybe from Indiana.</p>
									<p>Marion, 50, spends her days at Irving Street &ldquo;just cleaning my clothes.&rdquo; Sometimes, she goes &ldquo;out walking to see trees and flowers.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Marion usually sits alone in the living room or on the front porch, not responding if someone says hello to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get along with nobody,&rdquo; she says.</p>
									<p>Marion, a stout woman with turquoise sneakers, layers of clothes and a white sun hat, has what therapists call an &ldquo;altered mental state, not otherwise specified.&rdquo; But ask her whether she has any mental health issues and she says, &ldquo;I just have a problem with iron. I take iron pills.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>At Irving Street, she has her own bedroom and three meals a day.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I got no problems with my lifestyle,&rdquo; she says.</p>

									<p class="lead">She saw shadows coming at her, heard voices telling her what to do.</p>
									<p>Crystal Thomas, 36, describes what happened a few years ago as her &ldquo;mental breakdown,&rdquo; one that rattled her life so much she lost her four children to foster care and was evicted from her apartment.</p>
									<p>She was staying at a friend&rsquo;s home in Colorado Springs when the paranoia began. Crystal felt unsafe and took her children to live on the streets, sleeping in shelters or the Greyhound bus depot.</p>
									<p>They eventually rented a place in Denver&rsquo;s Sun Valley, one of the poorest parts of the city, but were evicted when Crystal and her boyfriend didn&rsquo;t make rent. The children now live with an aunt in Indiana.</p>
									<p>Crystal&rsquo;s boyfriend moved away without her, and she again was homeless, living in shelters and spending a month in Denver Health Medical Center&rsquo;s in-patient psychiatric unit.</p>
									<p>Then she got a call that there was a bed for her at Irving Street, where she has lived for more than two years. She has since been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which she keeps under control with medication.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m off of it, that&rsquo;s when the voices start up,&rdquo; she said.</p>
									<p>Crystal has stayed at Irving Street longer than most residents because it&rsquo;s hard to find an apartment to rent with an eviction and a criminal record.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to get a place right now, but I know I have to be patient.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Crystal grew up on the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. She never knew her father, and her mother died when she was 1. She bounced from state to state, staying with relatives and friends, for much of her life.</p>
									<p>She is hopeful that she will change her life&rsquo;s course, that she will manage her mental illness, act financially responsible and have her children returned to her.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I feel like I was blessed being so fortunate to come to this place,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really been like home to me. I feel like they got my back.&rdquo;</p>

									<p class="lead">Her childhood was full of nightmares.</p>
									<p>Sandra Castillo, 43,was assaulted by more than one of her mother&rsquo;s boyfriends while her mom was passed out drunk. Then her mother dropped her off at a friend&rsquo;s house and promised to pick her up the next morning &mdash; except she didn&rsquo;t come back for six months. By then, Sandra had been given to foster care.</p>
									<p>Sandra ran away at 14 and found her mother. At 15, she and her mom were bar-hopping in Mexico, where Sandra met a musician, got married and had her first baby at 16.</p>
									<p>There began a string of abusive relationships.</p>
									<p>As long as she can remember, Sandra had panic attacks &mdash; her heart would race and her breath shorten. She worried someone was chasing her.</p>
									<p>She lost several jobs and then lost her house after her two children had grown up and moved out. She spent months living in homeless shelters around Colorado.</p>
									<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until she saw a therapist four years ago while living in a Boulder shelter that she learned why she had panic attacks. Sandra was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of her damaging childhood, as well as depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a very lonely life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning to understand myself and who I am. I&rsquo;m learning how to cope with everything being here.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;This past five years, I&rsquo;ve started over I don&rsquo;t know how many times.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Sandra said she constantly battles a feeling of fear and dread, thinking another bad thing is just around the corner. &ldquo;Some days when I&rsquo;m here, I feel stuck,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some days there are pretty bad breakdowns where everything just seems sad.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>After a year at Irving Street, Sandra still finds it hard to relax, to shake the feeling that she will have to leave at any moment. But she is trying.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I feel like I belong somewhere finally, with people who understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>

									<p class="lead">She was holding on, a single mom with two kids and a job at the Division of Youth Corrections.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Then it was like it all went to hell,&rdquo; said Tara Lea Chamblin, recalling the year when depression took over and her life fell apart.</p>
									<p>She was drinking too much, using marijuana and cocaine to try to make herself feel better. She had thoughts of leaving her car running in the garage as she and her kids sat inside and &ldquo;just went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>At work, she was receiving &ldquo;corrective actions,&rdquo; and she felt like she was &ldquo;weighted down by a ton of bricks.&rdquo; She quit, then called her sister and said, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m drowning.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Tara&rsquo;s son and daughter stayed with their aunt while Tara checked into Denver Health Medical Center, where she was medicated for anxiety, sleep problems and borderline personality disorder.</p>
									<p>Tara, who wears silver rings and a pink handkerchief around her dark-brown hair, talks so fast that sometimes she sounds breathless. She says her moods go up and down like a &ldquo;highway-to-hell roller coaster.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You can be the life of the party, thinking, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Jesus. I can change this.&rsquo; And then I&rsquo;m sunk.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>After she left Denver Health, Tara lived with a boyfriend for a while, then became homeless and floated among cheap motels. She was homeless when her mother killed herself at home in Monte Vista during an argument with her father. &ldquo;I think everybody has a breaking point, and my mom just met hers. I&rsquo;ve had situations like that, when you&rsquo;re sick of it all. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Tara didn&rsquo;t know how to save herself.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;What if you ain&rsquo;t got no bootstraps? What if someone doesn&rsquo;t know how to pull themselves out of a black hole?&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Then she visited a mental health clinic and lucked into a bed at Irving Street. After two weeks in the women&rsquo;s home, she felt like she was living in a &ldquo;castle.&rdquo; She is grateful for the respite, wants to regain her life and repair her relationship with her teenage children.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I was good, and then I got lost for two years and now I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m who I am in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
